# A Simple 3D Renderer in HTML Canvas 2D

Currently working on this.

## Issues

- Slow because it is my self-implementation based on my understanding of the maths and concepts
- Only works with plain wavefront(.obj) files, with no materials, uv or other data attached. Only face and vertex data should be present.
